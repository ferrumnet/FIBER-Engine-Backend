# awsHelper.ts

### `awsSecretsManagerInit`

- Purpose: Initializes the AWS Secrets Manager client and retrieves secret values stored in AWS Secrets Manager.
- Parameters: None.
- Returns: A Promise that resolves when the secrets are successfully retrieved and set in the environment variables, or rejects in case of an error.
- Details:
  - Initializes a new AWS Secrets Manager client using the `region`, `accessKeyId`, and `secretAccessKey` retrieved from global environment settings.
  - Calls the `getSecretValue` method of the AWS Secrets Manager client, passing the secret name to retrieve.
  - Handles the response inside a callback:
    - If there's an error (e.g., secret not found or AWS API error), it logs the error and rejects the promise with an empty string.
    - If the secret is retrieved successfully, it checks if the secret is in string format. If so, it parses the secret and merges it into the global environment variables.
    - If the secret is in binary format, it decodes the binary data to ASCII and sets the `decodedBinarySecret` variable.
  - The promise is resolved after updating the environment variables or after handling any errors.

### Code snippet:

typescript

Copy code

`async awsSecretsManagerInit() {
  return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
    var client = new AWS.SecretsManager({
      region: region,
      accessKeyId: (global as any).environment.accessKeyId,
      secretAccessKey: (global as any).environment.secretAccessKey,
    });
    client.getSecretValue(
      { SecretId: secretName },
      function (err: any, data: any) {
        if (err) {
          console.log("aws error: " + err);
          reject("");
        } else {
          if ("SecretString" in data) {
            secret = data.SecretString;
            var secretJson = JSON.parse(secret);
            (global as any).environment = {
              ...secretJson,
              ...(global as any).environment,
            };
          } else {
            let buff = new Buffer(data.SecretBinary, "base64");
            decodedBinarySecret = buff.toString("ascii");
          }
          resolve("");
        }
      }
    );
  });
}`

This function is critical for the secure handling of sensitive configuration data within the AWS cloud environment, ensuring that secret keys and other credentials are properly managed and injected into the application runtime without hard-coding them into the source code.

# configurationHelper.ts

### Function: `getSlippage`

- Signature: `async getSlippage(slippage: string = ""): Promise<any>`
- Description: This function asynchronously retrieves the slippage configuration from the database.
- Parameters:
  - `slippage` (string, optional): A default value can be provided which, if present, will be returned directly.
- Returns: A Promise resolving to the slippage value as a string. If a slippage argument is provided, it returns that argument. Otherwise, it queries the database for the configuration settings, specifically looking for a slippage value. If found, it returns the slippage value converted to a string; if not found, it defaults to returning "2".
- Database Interaction:
  - It queries the `Configurations` collection/table in the database using `db.Configurations.findOne()` to fetch the current configuration.
- Error Handling: There's no explicit error handling in this function. If the database query fails or if the `Configurations` document is not set up correctly (e.g., missing the `slippage` field), this function might return `undefined` or an error might occur.

### Function: `getNativeTokens`

- Signature: `async getNativeTokens(): Promise<any>`
- Description: This function asynchronously fetches the list of native tokens from the database settings.
- Returns: A Promise that resolves to an array of native tokens. If the native tokens are found in the database, it returns this array; if not, it returns an empty array.
- Database Interaction:
  - Similar to `getSlippage`, it performs a database lookup using `db.Configurations.findOne()` to retrieve the `nativeTokens` from the current configuration.
- Error Handling: As with `getSlippage`, there's no explicit error handling. Any issues with the database access or document structure may lead to an unhandled exception or a returned value of `undefined`.

These functions rely heavily on the structure of the `Configurations` document in the database and assume successful database queries without handling potential exceptions or errors that could arise from the database operations.

# dexContractHelper.ts

### TypeScript Interface: `Response`

- Purpose: Defines the structure for the response object used in DEX operations.
- Properties:
  - `responseMessage`: A `string` that holds messages related to the DEX operation, primarily error messages.
  - `amounts`: Holds any amount-related data returned by the DEX operation, type is not strictly defined (`any`).

### Function: `getAmountOut`

- Signature: `async getAmountOut(network: any, path: any, amount: any): Promise<Response>`
- Purpose: Asynchronously retrieves the output amount for a given input amount on a DEX, based on specified conditions like the conversion path.
- Parameters:
  - `network`: Represents the DEX network and includes the `dexContract`. This is passed as an `any` type, implying flexibility in the parameter's structure.
  - `path`: Used to define the token conversion path for which amounts out are calculated. Its type is not strictly defined (`any`).
  - `amount`: The input amount for which the output needs to be calculated. Also typed as `any`.
- Returns: A promise that resolves to a `Response` object containing either the result of the DEX operation or an error message.
- Behavior:
  - The function attempts to call `getAmountsOut` method of the `dexContract` object, passing the `amount` (converted to string) and `path`.
  - If the operation is successful, the `amounts` data from the DEX operation is stored.
  - If an error occurs (e.g., a liquidity issue or other operational fault), it catches the error, logs it, and stores the error message in `responseMessage`.
- Error Handling: Errors are logged and incorporated into the response message for clarity on the operation's outcome.

This documentation summarizes the contents and functionality provided by the file. The focus is on handling DEX operations with error management and flexible parameter usage to accommodate various network and contract structures.
