# forgeSignatureHelper.ts

1.  `createSignedPayment`:

    - Purpose: Creates a signed payment object with a signature and hash.
    - Parameters:
      - `chainId`: The blockchain network ID.
      - `payee`: The address receiving the payment.
      - `amount`: The amount to be transferred.
      - `targetToken`: The token to be transferred.
      - `contractAddress`: The address of the contract managing the transaction.
      - `salt`: A nonce to ensure uniqueness.
      - `destinationAssetType`: The type of asset.
      - `amountIn`: For swaps, the amount going in.
      - `amountOut`: For swaps, the amount coming out.
      - `targetFoundaryToken`: The specific token for foundry-related transactions.
      - `oneInchData`: Data related to 1Inch swaps.
      - `expiry`: Expiration time of the transaction.
      - `web3`: An instance of Web3.
    - Returns: An object containing a `signature` and `hash` of the transaction.

2.  `produceFoundaryHash`:

    - Purpose: Produces a cryptographic hash for transactions involving foundary assets.
    - Parameters: Similar to `createSignedPayment`, excluding parameters not relevant for foundary transactions.
    - Returns: A string representing the transaction hash.

3.  `produceOneInchHash`:

    - Purpose: Generates a hash for transactions involving 1Inch swap operations.
    - Parameters: Adjusted for 1Inch-specific data inputs.
    - Returns: A hash string of the transaction details.

4.  `domainSeparator`:

    - Purpose: Generates a domain separator used in EIP-712 compliant messages.
    - Parameters:
      - `web3`: An instance of Web3.
      - `chainId`: The blockchain network ID.
      - `contractAddress`: The smart contract address involved in the transaction.
    - Returns: A hash used to separate different domains (or contracts) within EIP-712 typed data.

5.  `getPrivateKey`:

    - Purpose: Retrieves the private key from global configuration.
    - Returns: The private key string.

6.  `fixSig`:

    - Purpose: Corrects the signature format to be compliant with Ethereum standards.
    - Parameters:
      - `sig`: The raw signature string.
    - Returns: The formatted signature string.

7.  `recoverAddress`:

    - Purpose: Recovers the address from a given signature and hash, primarily for verification purposes.
    - Parameters:
      - `signature`: The signature string.
      - `hash`: The hash string used during the signing process.
    - Returns: A boolean indicating if the recovery was successful, and if so, logs the recovered address.

Each function is integral to the operation of smart contract interactions, particularly in environments where transactions are signed off-chain for later execution on-chain, enhancing security and efficiency.
