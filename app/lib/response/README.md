# asyncMiddleware.ts

### Function: `asyncMiddlewareLayer`

Purpose: The `asyncMiddlewareLayer` function serves as a middleware wrapper for handling asynchronous operations within Express.js routes. It captures and handles any exceptions thrown during the promise execution of an Express.js request handler.

Parameters:

- `fn`: A function that represents the asynchronous operation of an Express.js route. It accepts three parameters:
  - `req` (any): The request object from Express.js.
  - `res` (any): The response object from Express.js.
  - `next` (any): The next middleware function in the Express.js route.

Returns:

- Returns a function that takes `req`, `res`, and `next` as arguments and processes them using the passed `fn` function.

Detailed Workflow:

1.  Initial Call: The returned function is invoked with `req`, `res`, and `next` arguments.
2.  Promise Handling: It immediately invokes the `fn` function within a `Promise.resolve()` to ensure any returned value is wrapped in a Promise. This allows for asynchronous processing.
3.  Error Handling: If the promise is rejected (i.e., an error occurs), the `.catch()` method handles the error. The error is processed through several conditional checks to normalize the error message:
    - Checks if `err.message` exists, if so, use it.
    - Else, check `err.msg`.
    - Else, delve deeper into `err.errors` if it's structured with nested properties, to extract a meaningful message.
    - If `err.errors` is an array, it iterates to consolidate messages.
4.  Response: After determining the most descriptive error message, it sends a `400 Bad Request` HTTP response using `res.http400(err)`.
5.  Catch Block: If an error occurs during error processing, it catches and handles it similarly by sending a `400` response.

Usage: This function is typically used in an Express.js application where asynchronous operations need proper error handling without crashing the server or leaving the client hanging. It ensures that all errors are caught and handled gracefully.

# responseAppender.ts

### Module: `responseAppender.ts`

- Dependencies

  - `standardResponses`: A module required at the beginning of the file which presumably contains methods for standard HTTP responses.

- Function: `module.exports`

  - Type: Module export function
  - Description: This function returns another function that acts as middleware for Express applications. It appends standard HTTP response methods to the `res` (response) object.
  - Parameters:
    - `req`: The HTTP request object. It is not directly used within the middleware function but is part of the middleware signature.
    - `res`: The HTTP response object. This is where standard response methods are appended.
    - `next`: The next middleware function in the stack.
  - Appended Methods:
    - `res.http200`: Appends a method for handling HTTP 200 responses. The actual implementation details would be in the `standardResponses` module.
    - `res.http400`: Appends a method for handling HTTP 400 responses.
    - `res.http401`: Appends a method for handling HTTP 401 responses.
    - `res.http404`: Appends a method for handling HTTP 404 responses.
  - Operation: After appending these methods, the `next()` function is called to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack.

This setup allows any route handlers that follow this middleware in the Express application to use these appended methods directly on the `res` object for sending standard responses, simplifying the error handling and response management across the application.

# standardResponses.ts

### `http200(data: any)`

This function is used to construct a standard HTTP 200 response.

- Parameters:
  - `data`: An object containing at least two properties: `message` and `phraseKey`. These are used in the response to provide a custom message and a phrase key. Both properties are optional; if not provided, defaults ('Success' for message and an empty string for phraseKey) are used.
- Returns:
  - A JSON object formatted as a response, containing a `status` object with code 200 and the provided message and phraseKey, and a `body` object with the data minus the message and phraseKey.

### `http400(err: any, key: string = '')`

This function generates a standard HTTP 400 (Bad Request) response.

- Parameters:
  - `err`: A message or object describing the error.
  - `key`: An optional phrase key to include in the response.
- Returns:
  - A JSON object formatted as a response with a 400 status code, the error message, and phraseKey.

### `http401(err: any)`

This function generates a standard HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) response.

- Parameters:
  - `err`: A message or object describing the reason for unauthorized status.
- Returns:
  - A JSON object formatted as a response with a 401 status code and the error message.

### `http404(err: any, key: string = '')`

This function generates a standard HTTP 404 (Not Found) response.

- Parameters:
  - `err`: A message or object describing what was not found.
  - `key`: An optional phrase key to include in the response.
- Returns:
  - A JSON object formatted as a response with a 404 status code, the error message, and phraseKey.

This detailed documentation should help developers understand and use these functions effectively within the FIBER Engine Backend.

# standardStatuses.ts

### `status200(data: any)`

This function is used to generate a standard HTTP 200 OK response. It accepts a parameter `data`, which can be of any type, and returns an object with the following properties:

- `code`: The HTTP status code, set to 200.
- `data`: The data passed to the function, returned as part of the response.

### `status400(data: any)`

This function is used to generate a standard HTTP 400 Bad Request response. It accepts a parameter `data`, which can be of any type, and returns an object with the following properties:

- `code`: The HTTP status code, set to 400.
- `message`: The data passed to the function, used here as a message indicating the nature of the error.

### `status401(data: any)`

This function is used to generate a standard HTTP 401 Unauthorized response. It accepts a parameter `data`, which can be of any type, and returns an object with the following properties:

- `code`: The HTTP status code, set to 401.
- `message`: The data passed to the function, used here as a message indicating that authentication is required.

Each function is a straightforward utility for constructing a response object with a specific HTTP status code and accompanying data or message.
