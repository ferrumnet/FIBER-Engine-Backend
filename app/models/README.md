# configurations.ts

1.  Module Dependencies and Initial Setup:

    - `mongoose`: Required to interface with MongoDB for schema definitions and data modeling.
    - `collectionName`: A variable set to "configurations" which specifies the name of the MongoDB collection this schema will be associated with.

2.  Schema Definition:

    - `slippage`: A numerical field initialized to `0`. This likely represents the default slippage tolerance in some transaction context.
    - `nativeTokens`: An array to hold token configurations for various chains. Each token configuration object includes:
      - `chainId`: A string to identify the blockchain network.
      - `symbol`: The symbol of the token.
      - `address`: The primary address of the token on the blockchain.
      - `wrappedAddress`: An address for a wrapped version of the token.
      - `oneInchAddress`: Likely an address related to the 1inch liquidity protocol for this token.
    - `isActive`: A Boolean field initialized to `true`, indicating whether the configuration is currently active.
    - `createdAt`: A date field to record when the configuration was created, defaults to the current date and time.
    - `updatedAt`: A date field to record when the configuration was last updated, also defaults to the current date and time.

3.  Model Compilation:

    - The schema is compiled into a model named `gasFeesModel` using Mongoose's `model()` method. This model is associated with the `configurations` collection in MongoDB.

4.  Exports:

    - The `gasFeesModel` is exported for use elsewhere in the application, allowing other parts of the application to interact with the `configurations` collection through the defined schema.

This structure provides a robust way to manage configuration settings related to transaction parameters and token information within the application.

# gasFees.ts

### File: `gasFees.ts`

This TypeScript file defines a Mongoose model for handling gas fee configurations in a MongoDB collection named `"gasFees"`. The model structure (`schema`) includes various fields related to gas fees for Ethereum transactions, allowing for both static and dynamic configuration.

#### Model Schema:

- maxFeePerGas (`String`): The maximum fee per gas that can be used for transactions. Defaults to an empty string if not specified.
- maxPriorityFeePerGas (`String`): The priority fee per gas to incentivize miners to include the transaction in a block. Defaults to an empty string if not specified.
- gasLimit (`String`): The limit on the maximum amount of gas that can be used for the transaction. Defaults to an empty string if not specified.
- bufferForGasEstimation (`Number`): A numerical buffer to adjust the gas estimation for transactions. Defaults to `0`.
- bufferForWithdrawal (`Number`): A numerical buffer to adjust the gas requirement for withdrawals. Defaults to `0`.
- isAllowedDynamicGasLimit (`Boolean`): A flag indicating whether dynamic gas limits can be used. Defaults to `false`.
- chainId (`String`): The identifier for the blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum mainnet, testnets). Defaults to an empty string.
- dynamicValues:
  - maxFeePerGas (`String`): Dynamic setting for maximum fee per gas, allowing real-time adjustment based on network conditions. Defaults to an empty string.
  - maxPriorityFeePerGas (`String`): Dynamic setting for priority fee per gas. Defaults to an empty string.
- isActive (`Boolean`): A flag to enable or disable the use of this gas fee configuration. Defaults to `true`.
- createdAt (`Date`): The timestamp when the record was created. Defaults to the current date and time.
- updatedAt (`Date`): The timestamp when the record was last updated. Defaults to the current date and time.

#### Model Declaration:

The schema is registered with Mongoose under the collection name `"gasFees"`, and it exports the model as `gasFeesModel`.

This file uses strict mode for JavaScript and requires the `mongoose` library to define and interact with schemas in MongoDB.

# index.ts

### Function Documentation

- Purpose: Automatically import all files (except 'plugins' and 'index.js') in the current directory as modules and export them with their file names transformed into a capitalized module name format.

- Method: Uses Node.js's `fs` (file system) module to read all files in the directory of the script.

- Code Breakdown:

  typescript

  Copy code

  `var fs = require('fs');
fs.readdirSync(__dirname).forEach(function (file: any) {
  if (file !== 'plugins' && file !== 'index.js') {
    let moduleName = file.split('.')[0];
    exports[moduleName[0].toUpperCase() + moduleName.slice(1)] = require('./' + moduleName);
  }
});`

  - `var fs = require('fs')`: Includes the Node.js file system module to interact with the file system.
  - `fs.readdirSync(__dirname)`: Synchronously reads the directory contents where the script resides.
  - `.forEach(function (file: any))`: Iterates over each file in the directory.
  - `if (file !== 'plugins' && file !== 'index.js')`: Filters out the 'plugins' directory and 'index.js' file to avoid unnecessary imports or recursion.
  - `let moduleName = file.split('.')[0]`: Extracts the file name without the extension to use as the module name.
  - `exports[moduleName[0].toUpperCase() + moduleName.slice(1)] = require('./' + moduleName)`: Capitalizes the first letter of the module name, retains the rest as is, and assigns the imported module to the exports object. This makes the module accessible from outside using a named import corresponding to the file name.

### Usage

- This setup allows any JavaScript file in the `app/models` directory (with exceptions noted) to be automatically imported and ready to use elsewhere in the project without manually importing each model file.

# randomKeys.ts

### Imports and Setup

- `mongoose`: The file imports `mongoose`, a package that provides a straightforward way to model your application data. It is used here to define schemas and create models.
- `collectionName`: A variable set to the string `'randomKeys'`, which specifies the name of the MongoDB collection that this model will interact with.

### Schema Definition

- `schema`: This variable holds a schema defined using `mongoose.Schema`. The schema defines the structure of documents within the `randomKeys` collection. Here's a breakdown of the schema properties:
  - `key`: A string with a default value of an empty string. This field is likely used to store a key or identifier.
  - `isActive`: A boolean that tracks whether the key is active, with a default value of `true`.
  - `createdAt`: A date field that records when the document was created, with a default value set to the current date and time at the moment of creation.
  - `updatedAt`: A date field that indicates the last update time of the document, also defaulting to the current date and time.

### Model Creation

- `randomKeysModel`: This variable creates a model from the defined schema. The model uses the `collectionName` ('randomKeys') and allows for interacting with the collection according to the defined schema.

### Module Exports

- The model `randomKeysModel` is exported from the module, making it available for use in other parts of the application where interacting with the `randomKeys` collection is necessary.

# transactionLogs.ts

### Module Imports and Setup

- Mongoose: The module uses Mongoose to interact with MongoDB. Mongoose provides a straightforward schema-based solution to model application data.
- Collection Name: The data will be stored in the MongoDB collection named `"transactionLogs"`.

### Schema Definition

A Mongoose schema defines the structure of the document, default values, validators, etc. Here is the schema used in this module:

- `swapTransactionHash`: A string that defaults to an empty string. This likely represents the hash of a swap transaction in the blockchain.
- `sourceWalletAddress`: A string representing the wallet address from where the transaction originated, defaults to an empty string.
- `sourceTokenContractAddress`: A string indicating the contract address of the token being transferred, defaults to an empty string.
- `sourceNetworkChainId`: A string representing the chain ID of the source network, defaults to an empty string.
- `sourceAmount`: A string representing the amount of tokens transferred from the source, defaults to an empty string.
- `destinationTokenContractAddress`: A string representing the contract address of the token at the destination, defaults to an empty string.
- `destinationNetworkChainId`: A string representing the chain ID of the destination network, defaults to an empty string.
- `destinationWalletAddress`: A string for the wallet address at the destination, defaults to an empty string.
- `withdrawTransactionHash`: A string that defaults to an empty string, potentially representing the hash of a transaction withdrawing tokens at the destination.
- `isActive`: A boolean indicating whether the log is active, defaulted to true.
- `responseCode`: A number that can store a response code related to the transaction, defaulted to an empty string.
- `responseMessage`: This field is defined without a type, allowing any data structure as per Mongoose's flexibility.

### Timestamps

- `createdAt` and `updatedAt`: Both fields are of type `Date`, defaulting to the current date. These fields automatically track when a document is created and last updated.

### Model Compilation

- The schema is compiled into a model with the name `transactionLogsModel` using the specified collection. This model is then exported for use elsewhere in the application to interact with the `transactionLogs` collection.

This detailed explanation covers the purpose and functionality of each part of the schema and model setup in the `transactionLogs.ts` file, providing a clear understanding of how transaction logs are structured and stored in the database.
