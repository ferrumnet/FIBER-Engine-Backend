# Multiswap SDK

The goal of `Multiswap SDK` is to provide generalized interface for interacting with multiswap contracts on different chains.

## How to maintain

To maintain the interface, when multiswap contract changes or any new functions needed, it will be added on this file and all the contract interaction with Multiswap will need to be done through this interface.

## Contracts

- [Multiswap](./multiswap.md)
- [FIBER Router](./router.md)
